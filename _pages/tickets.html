      <h2>What ticket should I buy?</h2>
      <p>If you are a student, unemployed, on a lower income, or feel you would benefit from a reduced-priced ticket, please pick the student/diversity rate. If your employer is paying your way then please pick the corporate rate. If you work for a small company, or the corporate rate is not reasonable for your company, then please pick the individual rate. State or government institutions and non-profit organizations should use the corporate rate if they are able.</p>

   <h2>Ticket Types</h2>
    <p><strong>Individual:</strong> If your company has 5 or fewer employees, or if you’re purchasing your own ticket without any help from your employer.</p>
    <p><strong>Corporate:</strong> If your employer (with more than 5 employees) is paying for your ticket. State or government institutions and non-profit organizations should use the corporate rate if they are able.</p>
    <p><strong>Student/Diversity:</strong> If you’re unemployed, on a lower income, are a member of an underrepresented group, or would benefit from a lower-priced ticket for another reason. <strong>If your company is paying for your ticket, you are not eligible for this ticket type.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Tutorials ($150):</strong> They are a separate cost from your conference ticket. You can register for a tutorial without registering for the conference itself. You must register for a specific tutorial.</p>
    <p><strong>Sprints (free):</strong> The ticket is free, but we ask you to register so we can buy you lunch. You do not have to register for the conference itself to register for sprints.</p>
