      Hundreds of tiny details, carefully considered. We thought
      carefully about how we would want the ticket purchasing
      experience to be like for our own events. A clean,
      mobile-friendly event homepage and checkout experience.
      A simple, fast checkout that attendees love. Quick payments
      using Stripe (say goodbye to waiting for your money). With
      Tito, your data is your data, we never market to your
      customers. So if you run events, come and take a look for
      yourself. The last thing we want you to worry about is your
      event software.
